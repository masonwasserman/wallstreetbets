In this repository, there are two ipynb files. The first one is for exploratory data analysis and the second one includes preprocessing and running thr binary classifiers. The zip file includes all data necessary for this project. Please run each line of code in both files consecutively to ensure the code runs properly. For the main ipynb file, the preprocessing step takes a while so there is code that saves the preprocessed data in its own csv file. If you save this file, you can then skip the preprocessing step when running the code again.
